The previous AI engineer successfully built a full-stack gaming zone website, Karthikeya Games Galaxy, from scratch. Initially, the focus was on a modern dark theme with neon green accents, following strict UI/UX guidelines (winwinkit). The engineer developed a React frontend with mock data, including key pages like Home, Services, Pricing, Gallery, Contact, and a Booking system. Upon user approval, a FastAPI backend with MongoDB was implemented, handling CRUD operations for game data and bookings, replacing mock data. Image integration was crucial, handled by a  to fetch relevant gaming visuals. The engineer diligently addressed user feedback, enhancing styling, adding more detailed game lists, and integrating contact information and a custom logo. Most recently, the user requested a complete website redesign inspired by Blizzard.com, leading the engineer to initiate a new design with a blue gaming theme. The current work involves implementing this new design, with the latest user feedback highlighting readability and color contrast issues on the new banner.
